# shuriken-evasion
This game was created by me using pygame for a 7-day long Winter Game Jam organized by the Game Development Club, IIT Kanpur.

The images "shurikenBlack.png", "shurikenRed.png" and "snowySky.png" were created using GIMP 

The sounds "explosion.wav" and "gameOver.wav" were created using bfxr
